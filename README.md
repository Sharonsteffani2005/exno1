1. Write a Python program to select the 'name' and 'score' columns from the following DataFrame.
Sample DataFrame:


              exam_data = {'name': ['Anastasia', 'Dima', 'Katherine', 'James', 'Emily', 'Michael', 'Matthew', 'Laura', 'Kevin', 'Jonas'],

               'score': [12.5, 9, 16.5, np.nan, 9, 20, 14.5, np.nan, 8, 19],

              'attempts': [1, 3, 4, 3, 5, 3, 6, 1, 7, 1] } 
OUTPUT:

2. For the above dataframe, Write a program to select the data who's attempt is greater than 3.
OUTPUT:

3. Write python code for indexing rows and columns based on the following conditions:
Assume we have the following dataframe:
data = {'name': ['Alice', 'Bob', 'Charlie', 'Dave'],

        'age': [25, 35, 40, 28],

        'gender': ['F', 'M', 'M', 'M'],

        'salary': [50000, 70000, 60000, 80000]}
a. Select rows where age is greater than 30:
b. Select rows where name contains 'e':
c. Select rows where gender is 'M' and salary is greater than 65000:
d. Select columns 'name' and 'age'
OUTPUT (a) & (b):
image

OUTPUT (c) & (d):
image

ACTIVITY 2:
1. Write python code for indexing rows and columns using iloc or loc method based on the following conditions:
a. select the rows where clients with primary education have subscribed to a deposit?
OUTPUT:
image

b. select the rows where clients who have not subscribed to a deposit?
OUTPUT:
image

c. select the rows where clients who have subscribed to a deposit either have a housing or a personal loan?
OUTPUT:
image

d. select the rows where clients with secondary education who have not subscribed to a deposit?
OUTPUT:
image

OUTPUT:
image

f. select the rows where unemployed clients who have not subscribed to deposit?
OUTPUT:
